Jeckyl can be used to create a parameters hash from a simple config file written in Ruby, having run whatever checks you want
on the file to ensure the values passed in are valid. All you need to do is define a class inheriting from Jeckyl, methods for
each parameter, its default, whatever checking rules are appropriate and even a comment for generating templates etc.
This is then used to parse a Ruby config file and create the parameters hash. Jeckyl 
comes complete with a utility to check a config file against a given class and to generate a default file for you to tailor.
